Week 2!

Our homework task for week two is to produce a storyboard on Canvas. This can be found linked below but 
first I will explain how I plan on maintaining continuity as the second part of our homework task! ðŸ˜‡
Continuity is defined as whether or not things are the same from shot to shot, and how that can impact 
the realism in regards to storytelling and how immeresed the audience feels as a result of this.
The show I have selected for this storyboard is moon knight; the scene specifically being an action shot 
in which his suit begins to materialise onto his skin accompanied by a "fwip!" As it sorts of wraps 
itself onto his skin- there is then a sort of cutaway shot that goes to his counterpart, for context 
there is two men sharing a body, one mind but a trauma response has led to a sort of schizophrenic type 
situation, moving back towards the topic; this cutaway follows the other one falling off of a building 
and the suit quickly forming on his skin- only truly visible in slow motion. I wrote poof to sort of 
emphasise the quick nature but also how it sort of just appears on him. he then falls indicated by the 
downwards nature of the arrow and he then lays on the ground momentarily. The cutaway then goes to him 
standing again brushing himself off- hence why i drew four arms, two being drawing with thinner lines 
to indicate the flailing movement as he rubs his hands up and down his body to get the dust off. 
This is where I ended it!

show due to disney plus not enabling recording for obvious copyright reasons

Lookiing back on this I now see my error- in class I made the mistake of thinking that the storyboard 
was for any scene, but as I perfect this assessment for submission I note that the storyboard is 
actually for our project. Which is actually easier in a sense and I am please I can write about it. 
I have decided to begin this storyboard from the time stamp of 19 seconds, when I use a close up shot 
of my Uncle's grave. This scene is crucial as explained in a passage I wrote further down last week. 
I thought it would be a good place to start seeing as it is the beginning of the story- he is the 
reason we moved. 
In the storyboard I have described it as a still shot, and extreme close up with very 
light jostling to sort of emphasise the feeling you get when you're not extremely physically reactive 
but you are beginning to realise the gravity of what has happened, and so carrying that metaphorical 
weight is beginning to literally move you. This is when the audio begins and also when the story begins.
The next shot is of the rose planted into his grave, a single one was in bloom and like me it was 
jostling too- I thought this was a nice small parallel in a way, or a shared emotion of sorts between 
our two planes of existence. A bit stretched but sometimes you believe in a presence like that even if 
it is just emotional influence causing it. 
I then used another still shot, but instead of an extreme close up I went an extreme wide shot- as my 
focus is the mountain, staring at me from the distance almost foreboding or telling me what was to 
come- where I would live. If you find the middle of the frame you will notice the mountain aligns with 
it almost perfectly. I thought it would be a nice touch as the mountain is returned to.
The next scene continues the story of his passing influencing our decision to leave, I found a for 
sale sign with an empty lot. Whilst we did not knock our house down it looks so foreign and different 
now with age and perspective that it almost feels as though we sold them something that wasn't ours- 
and so basically nothing in terms of sentimental value. For the choice of audio I selected two sound 
effects from the Adobe transportation effect pack, the first being a car trunk closing- something we 
would've heard shortly before leaving our home when it was a home to call ours, and then a car speeding 
off as we drove away.
This then flows into the next scene of my new backyard, unfortunately I could not find a house with a 
sold sign in my area as I thought it would've been quite a nice touch. Getting back to the narrative, 
you can note that I am once more looking out on that same mountain, but from the otherside, it is no 
longer sunny and replicating my emotions at the time. I couldn't just go back across the mountain, 
and even if I did it would not longer look the same on the other side. Sort of representing how we 
feel when looking back on childhood. 
The next scene is not the final for the entire assessment but is the final for this storyboard 
homework- I try to take a more uplifting point of view here, and show some water. Whilst this is 
just water from my local lake, it moved in a sort of serene shore like manner and so I selected the 
rolling waves sound effect from the ambience pack and placed it alongside these clips to show the 
everyday moments in which I find glimpses of my childhood present.

Storyboard for my self portrait!
The mental/verbal sort of storyboard for my self portrait is that it revolves around nostalgia and 
sort of missed feelings of childhood etc. it begins just with a quick shot of my yard, some cigarettes 
and then there is a cutaway shot to some similar weather in which we are now at the beach- my childhood 
home beach. so essentially a match cut. i had also thought of doing this with a sea shell and will 
experiment still potentially using this idea- the shell will then appear throughout every scene as i 
find that every day little things bring me back to past emotions etc because it symbolises me growing 
up at the beach. obviously this could change as time goes forward but for now that is an idea i keep 
going back to. 
A little update returning to this days later- I have found my seashell and will refilm about 40 seconds 
of footage to try to include it as best as I can as a small link between everything as the beach was my 
home and something we always come back to in a way. i have included a photo of it so that you may look 
out for it if it isn't as obvious in certain scenes I have yet to film. I have also decided to make a 
trip to our local cemetery as my Uncle is the reason we ended up moving here and a lot of big things in
our life were made possible thanks to him; such as moving here and travelling back and forth between 
Australia and Canada. I had thoughts of potentially picking up the seashell from his grab in the 
beginning clip and then having an editing technique that makes it look as though I have been shot back 
in time- and the whole self portrait is like living in a memory? I must play around with this as I 
already have footage but I am certain I will be able to incorporate it and twist some things around. 

Yet another update!

Unfortunately due to accessibility issues I am no longer able to make it to the beach at which I used 
to live. This obviously posed a ginormous issue as the entire direction of the project depended on it 
in many ways, and I really had to scramble and decide between a first option in which I would come up 
with an entirely new idea; which is obviously less than ideal seeing as to how much work I had sunk 
into the whole thought process. My second, which is what I have gone with is to go to the closest body 
of water near me- a lake, and try to emanate the same feelings from it. This meant that I would not 
only have to heavily rely on my writing as a back up but sound effects too; things such as the 
ambience beach sound effects found in Adobe, as well as my ability to find metaphors in the visuals 
presenting in front of me. 
I immediately visited said lake and began to film as much footage as possible whilst attempting to 
keep it unique. I have also sort of tweaked my storyline; it will still be a short story of my move 
and self potrait of feelings but will grow from a sort of sad piece into one of a happier tone; 
towards the end half of my work I will begin to show things that make me happy, and how sometimes you 
just need time to come around/get used to something.

For the music; i am looking for something that sort of encapsulates the music of terraria/minecraft, 
moreso minecraft not only as it is a childhood favourite of mine spent playing with people i love but 
also because it gives you that sad bittersweetness of not being able to return to what was.
After doing some light investigating as to where I can find good quality copyright free music- 
I discovered a website called sound stripe. This website did require a sign up but downloads were free 
and it was secure. I downloaded two tracks, and settled for "Feathered Aurora" containing piano but 
also some light synth. It sits quite close to the ideal sound I was after- I did need to access it 
through apple music but fortunately I am a member. I now need to learn how to download it as an audio 
file, if this isn't possible I could film the sound through a microphone and turn that into one if 
easier; I just worry the sound quality will turn out lesser but I will experiment nonetheless.

Returning to this! I have found music; the song "Aurora" by Featherland. It is completely copyright 
free and encapsulates what I am attempting to convey.
As for sound effects, I skimmed through RMITs selection from the link on Canvas and decided on the 
ambience 2 pack. I used a total of four throughout my project and I think they each fit nicely.

Coming back to this again. I wasn't the most pleased with my music, and so although it is the third 
last day prior to submission I have replaced it. I searched YouTube for copyright free music and found 
an artist who uploads copyright free covers/versions of popular video game music. I drifted towards a 
personal sentimental favourite of mine, The Legend of Zelda, and selected two covered tracks. 
Neither really have a name from the artist but the songs they are based off are named "Title theme" 
and "Fairy's fountain". Whilst tweaked slightly they are still close to their original counterparts 
and have a nice feeling.
I also opted to start the music on the extreme close up of Uncle Damian's grave, as that is when the 
story begins. I believe I did mention this somewhere but I thought I would clarify again.

Explaining the first effect- I used the sound of rolling waves to sort of show how I see hear and feel 
my old home in my current home, whenever I see moving water even if in a lake I feel like I am almost at the beach again and just remember that constant sound ticking all throughout my days as well as the smell of the air. This is placed at the time stamp of 42 seconds and goes until 57 seconds. I thought it most fitting here despite the clips of water moving longer as when I am sitting right next to it the proximity sort of amps up the feelings and seeing it clearly is like looking into a mirror of the past in a way.
The next I selected and imported was from the vehicle sound effect pack- it is played at the time stamp
 of 33 seconds and goes until 38 seconds. I wanted to use the sound of the car starting/moving to 
 represent travel and departure. Elaborating; it is because as soon as my Uncle had passed and we 
 finished his funeral our move was almost immediately after- a fresh start, and so it is supposed to 
 symbolise the swiftness of the change. As the sound fades out we move on to the next clip of my 
 backyard- I waited until the weather was rather mundane for this to sort of replicate the emotions 
 within the household and the apparent lack of appreciation for the sudden living change. I hoped that 
 when I placed in my future clips with the bright sun that it would sort of become a contrast sort of, 
 symbolising how I went from resenting where I lived to seeing some positives in it and the way that it 
 can still remind me of home. Obiviously not being able to get to the beach greatly affected where 
 I was going with this but I thought that it is still water and still something I can use to my 
 advantage as I wasn't fond of the idea in which I'd have to change my entire direction of the project.

Week 2 Session 2!

For this sessions homework I have been tasked with selecting a key moment from my self portrait video 
that my entire project is likely to depend on. 
I have selected the first scene- which seems cliche but it truly does make the story and help connect 
each segment without words. 
This scene is a short landscape clip of my Uncle's resting place, just a short one with some light 
ambience through the nature sounds including wind and local birds. I have decided that I will not add 
music to these first few seconds as there is a certain peace in it. This then quickly cuts to a 
seashell in front of him, I will pick this up and it will metaphorically take me back in time to my 
childhood- something that made me who I am now and tasked me with the challenge of completely starting 
over in a sense. 
This scene is crucial, as aforementioned it will make the story- this seashell will be with me every 
step of the way and symbolise my childhod whilst representing how my past is something I come back to 
in regular everyday life. 

A justification for how I plan on using sound design for this moment is having the first few short 
clips of 'memories'before the music slowly fades in have similar audios- for example the birds will be 
the same, since they are common in my area living rurally, I will sample audio clips of different 
chirps. So when the second and third clips play as I being to reminisce I recall the sound of the 
birds as I walked along the beach, or a day in my childhood backyard. How those birds at the cemetery 
are the same, and something consistent. This will keep that flow of sort of past and present 
connections going. 

The emotional tone of the broader portrait is a bittersweetness- I want to elicit feelings of 
nostalgia from my audience as they sort of look through my lens, rose coloured glasses as I remember 
everything good from childhood and how I both do and don't find that to be a part of the everyday 
living now. Editing choices supporting this will be match cuts- moments that replicate each other so 
much so that they almost fade into one another as I see those similarities. Fades to black and white 
will also include this as I will use them to represent past- since we usually correlate black and white
 with archaic sort of footage and past things in a sense. Perhaps I am looking out into the water for 
 the last time and it fades to black and white. Dissolving techniques will also help this as it's like 
 something melting away in your hand or escpaing/falling far away from you. I could be in the car 
 driving past the water and then the clip dissolves, and as I wake up I am in the country, somewhere 
 new- Currently my grandparents who live close to me have an empty lot next to them, and so I could 
 utilise that for sale sign and have it act as either the empty lot we bought or the empty lot we sold 
 as we said goodbye to an era goneby, our childhood home. 

Something the audience needs to understand as the relationship between each shot is that they are all 
replicating a sort of chronologial sequence of memories- me growing up to become this person and how 
influential I found my uncle as a person and the beach as my home to be. It is telling a story without 
actually telling a story. The connection I want to forge is that where I am now and where I have lived 
all goes back to my Uncle, he lived at the beach first and we followed, when he was ill he came here 
as it was his childhood town and again we followed when he passed to sort of be with him without 
physically being with him. The influence he has had despite my unawareness in the past- something 
typical of a childs mind, is something that I really want to try and portray. 

The rhythm, tempo and pace I want to establish during this moment are what I would say slow paced. 
I want looking back on these memories to feel meaningful and just a bit slower. Something i look back 
on lovingly at a calm pace because it is just a mental place I am comfortable sitting in. My editing 
will be less frequent clip cutting- and if I am going to do a quick cut it will be something a bit 
softer. In class last week we went over a few clips and noted that in action shots there were frequent 
clips during a bank robbery as well as an escape scene- multiple camera angles as well. I am looking 
at something opposite to this, gentle soft and slow camera angles- so it's kind of like you're 
skimming back through foggy memories and attempting recollection of thoughts. Perhaps I could find a 
way to create a light sort of blur without editing as the camera spis to turn and then we enter 
another clip beginning with that same spinning motion to create a match cut. I will experiment with 
this just making basic clips at home. 

With my new change I really do want to emphasise that the ending section- after my first audio fades out,
and the new miscellaneous clips begin is that the second half takes on a happy tone. Emotions of 
acceptance
and feelings of warmth and gratefulness to be somewhere you are still loved and taken care of. A home
that may take getting used to but is still a home nonetheless.
