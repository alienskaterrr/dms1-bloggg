Week 1!

Hello there,  and welcome to my blog. To begin I am starting with my first homework task; which includes the below account of my first lesson and scavenger hunt. I was aided by my two group members Matilda and Will who were just lovely and super quick and onto things- seeing as some of the things we needed to find were described in a somewhat cryptic manner. 
I hope this works as I am new to this type of code and will need to better familiarise myself with something like this for future lessons.

Thank you, and enjoy I suppose.

Describing the process of finding itself, we began by reading everything as a group and just having a bit of friendly chit chat- introductions and such. The library was our first spot as we underestimated the difficulty to be had in finding something we thought would be more noticeable; this being the book containing Digital Media wisdom, but I had never visited the library  and so I had imagined a very big sign signalling the media section and so forth, we sort of gave up and decided to search for something easier, coming back later. 
On our way out we found/noticed the draped paper, it sort of looked like a net and so we thought it may have been number three, the wide net strung above; I am still not sure if we were correct or not, but it was convenient and we hadn't noticed any other nets in our time on campus. 
As we moved away from this we glanced to the right and saw the study area worthy of a dark sith. Something about the mirroring pods seemed like a death star slowly opening to reveal a lightsaber fight or a dormant Lord waiting for someone to come challenge them- we all agreed on this, and so we confidently ticked that one off. 
The hands were also quite obvious, seeing as they are alone in being the only two disembodied hands and extremely ape-like. Walking across from this to the little alley leading to the basketball courts we noticed signage pointing to the old gaol and sort of drew the correlation between that and condemned seeing as prisoners aren't the most well-like members of society. The door, once found, was definitely the one as in the short description seen in the background of our selfie we noted the word condemned was included in the passage. 
The golden globe atop of a tower of eights was also semi obvious as it is one of a kind and quite bright when hit by the sun- it was more difficult to get in a photo with all of us but we managed as seen below.
The explosive cup of coffee sort of had us a bit confused at first and speculating whether or not it was an art piece in the design area of campus, but then I had recalled the small shop close to the tram stop and made the brief comment about how it could be a metaphor and then Matilda noted on a digital map little bang coffee which confirmed suspicions. It haa a bomb with a cup of coffee in the logo- and so we snapped our next pic.
The wide out of this world vending machine was next, at first we thought it was one found on floor six, with a turtle logo, as it had a wide array of caffienated drinks made on the spot in front of you; very impressive. We did take a photo but then coming back down to the lower floor noticed the extremely large one close to the streaming room and thought it more likely to be our one.
The basement dwelling Blackbox was confusing at first- I thought of the ones found in aircrafts, and wondered if there was a section for people completing bachelors of aviation or aeronautical engineering, but then we wandered the "basement" and found the sign literally reading blackbox and had a sort of "oh" moment quickly followed by a selfie. 
The cultural drape winged friend one was something we thought on for quite a while as we circled popular areas but then matilda scanned the QR code next to the bronze statue and read the lore which revealed its Indigenous connections and something about an eagle which is, obviously, winged. As for the book, well... it probably isn't the right one.

homework week one session one attached belowwww! a sweet 30 second clip of my lovely second family the agudos; and a hike we often partake in. due to the frequent nature of said hike i have found it quite special and it now holds an important place in my heart despite being quite large for a "space".
