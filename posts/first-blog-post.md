hi there!!!
testing testing 123 you get the idea hahaha ðŸ¥¸ðŸ¥¸ðŸ¥¸
these are some lovely photos of todays scavenger hunt; which i found to be quite difficult. however this burden of difficulty was completely lifted by my two lovely teammates will and matilda, who i learnt a little bit about whilst exploring together :-D 

describing the process of finding itself, we began by reading everything as a group and just having a bit of friendly chit chat- the library was our first spot as we underestimated the difficulty to be had in finding something we thought would be more noticeable and.. emanating wisdom. on our way in we found the draped paper, not sure if we were correct or not, and then noticed the study area worthy of a dark sith. something about the mirroring pods seemed like a death star slowly opening to reveal a badass lightsaber fight- we all agreed on this. the hands were also quite obvious, seeing as well- they're two giant hands just existing and i assume the only pair on campus. the door of the condemned was next since it quite literally stated that the condemned walked through it; how could we go wrong? the golden orb/sphere/globe thingy was also painfully obvious as it was casually blinding me upon approaching it- i'm sure my optometrist will be most unhappy haha. exploding coffee sort of had us like what the heck at first but then i made the brief comment about how it could be a metaphor and then matilda shared little bang coffee which confirmed my suspicions. it has a sick bomb with a cup of coffee in the logo- it doesn't get more explosive than a war weapon does it? the vending machine was next, at first we thought it was a coffee making one on floor six with a turtle logo but then we noticed the glorious and extremely wide one close to the streaming area and thought "ah, yes." blackbox was confusing at first- i thought like oh as in like the plane blackbox they use to hear air wrecks last words on air crash investigation? but then we wandered the "basement" and found the sign literally reading blackbox and had a sort of "oh" moment realising pretty quickly that was it. the cultural drape winged friend one was super like what the heck but then matilda scanned the QR code and read the lore which revealed its Indigenous connections and something about an eagle which is, obviously, winged. As for the book, well... it probably isn't the right one. But it's A book, and hey we were short on time and sort of like better than nothing- not the best mindest but hey it works.
