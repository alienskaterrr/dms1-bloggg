Week 1!

Hello there,  and welcome to my blog. To begin I am starting with my first homework task; which includes the below account of my first lesson and scavenger hunt. I was aided by my two group members Matilda and Will who were just lovely and super quick and onto things- seeing as some of the things we needed to find were described in a somewhat cryptic manner. 
I hope this works as I am new to this type of code and will need to better familiarise myself with something like this for future lessons.

Thank you, and enjoy I suppose.

Describing the process of finding itself, we began by reading everything as a group and just having a bit of friendly chit chat- introductions and such. The library was our first spot as we underestimated the difficulty to be had in finding something we thought would be more noticeable; this being the book containing Digital Media wisdom, but I had never visited the library  and so I had imagined a very big sign signalling the media section and so forth, we sort of gave up and decided to search for something easier, coming back later. 
On our way out we found/noticed the draped paper, it sort of looked like a net and so we thought it may have been number three, the wide net strung above; I am still not sure if we were correct or not, but it was convenient and we hadn't noticed any other nets in our time on campus. 
As we moved away from this we glanced to the right and saw the study area worthy of a dark sith. Something about the mirroring pods seemed like a death star slowly opening to reveal a lightsaber fight or a dormant Lord waiting for someone to come challenge them- we all agreed on this, and so we confidently ticked that one off. 
The hands were also quite obvious, seeing as they are alone in being the only two disembodied hands and extremely ape-like. Walking across from this to the little alley leading to the basketball courts we noticed signage pointing to the old gaol and sort of drew the correlation between that and condemned seeing as prisoners aren't the most well-like members of society. The door, once found, was definitely the one as in the short description seen in the background of our selfie we noted the word condemned was included in the passage. 
The golden globe atop of a tower of eights was also semi obvious as it is one of a kind and quite bright when hit by the sun- it was more difficult to get in a photo with all of us but we managed as seen below.
The explosive cup of coffee sort of had us a bit confused at first and speculating whether or not it was an art piece in the design area of campus, but then I had recalled the small shop close to the tram stop and made the brief comment about how it could be a metaphor and then Matilda noted on a digital map little bang coffee which confirmed suspicions. It haa a bomb with a cup of coffee in the logo- and so we snapped our next pic.
The wide out of this world vending machine was next, at first we thought it was one found on floor six, with a turtle logo, as it had a wide array of caffienated drinks made on the spot in front of you; very impressive. We did take a photo but then coming back down to the lower floor noticed the extremely large one close to the streaming room and thought it more likely to be our one.
The basement dwelling Blackbox was confusing at first- I thought of the ones found in aircrafts, and wondered if there was a section for people completing bachelors of aviation or aeronautical engineering, but then we wandered the "basement" and found the sign literally reading blackbox and had a sort of "oh" moment quickly followed by a selfie. 
The cultural drape winged friend one was something we thought on for quite a while as we circled popular areas but then matilda scanned the QR code next to the bronze statue and read the lore which revealed its Indigenous connections and something about an eagle which is, obviously, winged. As for the book, well... it probably isn't the right one.

homework week one session one attached belowwww! a sweet 30 second clip of my lovely second family the agudos; and a hike we often partake in. due to the frequent nature of said hike i have found it quite special and it now holds an important place in my heart despite being quite large for a "space".

And that is the lovely dragged out tale of our scavenger hunt.

Week 2!

Our homework task for week two is to produce a storyboard on Canvas. This can be found linked below but first I will explain how I plan on maintaining continuity as the second part of our homework task! ðŸ˜‡
Continuity is defined as whether or not things are the same from shot to shot, and how that can impact the realism in regards to storytelling and how immeresed the audience feels as a result of this.
the show i have selected for this storyboard is moon knight; the scene specifically being an action shot in which his suit begins to materialise onto his skin accompanied by a "fwip!" As it sorts of wraps itself onto his skin- there is then a sort of cutaway shot that goes to his counterpart, for context there is two men sharing a body, one mind but a trauma response has led to a sort of schizophrenic type situation, anyways this cutaway follows the other one falling off of a building and the suit quickly forming on his skin- only truly visible in slow mo. I wrote poof to sort of emphasise the quick nature but also how it sort of just appears on him. he then falls indicated by the downwards nature of the arrow and he then lays on the ground momentarily. The cutaway then goes to him standing again brushing himself off- hence why i drew four arms, two being drawing with thinner lines to indicate the flailing movement as he rubs his hands up and down his body to get the dust off. 
This is where I ended it due to space!
Here is the link to the video- it is a clip within a longer one apologies i could not source from the show due to disney plus not enabling recording for obvious copyright reasons
Moon Knight is fully owned by Disney falling underneath the Marvel franchise/merchandise

Storyboard for my self portrait!
The mental/verbal sort of storyboard for my self portrait is that it revolves around nostalgia and sort of missed feelings of childhood etc. it begins just with a quick shot of my yard, some cigarettes and then there is a cutaway shot to some similar weather in which we are now at the beach- my childhood home beach. so essentially a match cut. i had also thought of doing this with a sea shell and will experiment still potentially using this idea- the shell will then appear throughout every scene as i find that every day little things bring me back to past emotions etc because it symbolises me growin up at the beach. obviously this could change as time goes forward but for now that is an idea i keep going back to. 
A little update returning to this days later- I have found my seashell and will re=film about 40 seconds of footage to try to include it as best as I can as a small link between everything as the beach was my home and something we always come back to in a way. i have included a photo of it so that you may look out for it if it isn't as obvious in certain scenes I have yet to film. I have also decided to make a trip to our local cemetery as my Uncle is the reason we ended up moving here and a lot of big things in our life were made possible thanks to him; such as moving here and travelling back and forth between Australia and Canada. I had thoughts of potentially picking up the seashell from his grab in the beginning clip and then having an editing technique that makes it look as though I have been shot back in time- and the whole self portrait is like living in a memory? I must play around with this as I already have footage but I am certain I will be able to incorporate it and twist some things around. 

For the music; i am looking for something that sort of encapsulates the music of terraria/minecraft, moreso minecraft not only as it is a childhood favourite of mine spent playing with people i love but also because it gives you that sad bittersweetness of not being able to return to what was.
After doing some light investigating as to where I can find good quality copyright free music- I discovered a website called sound stripe. This website did require a sign up but downloads were free and it was secure. I downloaded two tracks, and settled for "Feathered Aurora" containing piano but also some light synth. It sits quite close to the ideal sound I was after- I did need to access it through apple music but fortunately I am a member. I now need to learn how to download it as an audio file, if this isn't possible I could film the sound through a microphone and turn that into one if easier; I just worry the sound quality will turn out lesser but I will experiment nonetheless.

Week 2 Session 2!

For this sessions homework I have been tasked with selecting a key moment from my self portrait video that my entire project is likely to depend on. 
I have selected the first scene- which seems cliche but it truly does make the story and help connect each segment without words. 
This scene is a short landscape clip of my Uncle's resting place, just a short one with some light ambience through the nature sounds including wind and local birds. I have decided that I will not add music to these first few seconds as there is a certain peace in it. This then quickly cuts to a seashell in front of him, I will pick this up and it will metaphorically take me back in time to my childhood- something that made me who I am now and tasked me with the challenge of completely starting over in a sense. 

This scene is crucial, as aforementioned it will make the story- this seashell will be with me every step of the way and symbolise my childhod whilst representing how my past is something I come back to in regular everyday life. 

A justification for how I plan on using sound design for this moment is having the first few short clips of 'memories'before the music slowly fades in have similar audios- for example the birds will be the same, since they are common in my area living rurally, I will sample audio clips of different chirps. So when the second and third clips play as I being to reminisce I recall the sound of the birds as I walked along the beach, or a day in my childhood backyard. How those birds at the cemetery are the same, and something consistent. This will keep that flow of sort of past and present connections going. 

The emotional tone of the broader portrait is a bittersweetness- I want to elicit feelings of nostalgia from my audience as they sort of look through my lens, rose coloured glasses as I remember everything good from childhood and how I both do and don't find that to be a part of the everyday living now. Editing choices supporting this will be match cuts- moments that replicate each other so much so that they almost fade into one another as I see those similarities. Fades to black and white will also include this as I will use them to represent past- since we usually correlate black and white with archaic sort of footage and past things in a sense. Perhaps I am looking out into the water for the last time and it fades to black and white. Dissolving techniques will also help this as it's like something melting away in your hand or escpaing/falling far away from you. I could be in the car driving past the water and then the clip dissolves, and as I wake up I am in the country, somewhere new- Currently my grandparents who live close to me have an empty lot next to them, and so I could utilise that for sale sign and have it act as either the empty lot we bought or the empty lot we sold as we said goodbye to an era goneby, our childhood home. 

Something the audience needs to understand as the relationship between each shot is that they are all replicating a sort of chronologial sequence of memories- me growing up to become this person and how influential I found my uncle as a person and the beach as my home to be. It is telling a story without actually telling a story. The connection I want to forge is that where I am now and where I have lived all goes back to my Uncle, he lived at the beach first and we followed, when he was ill he came here as it was his childhood town and again we followed when he passed to sort of be with him without physically being with him. The influence he has had despite my unawareness in the past- something typical of a childs mind, is something that I really want to try and portray. 

The rhythm, tempo and pace I want to establish during this moment are what I would say slow paced. I want looking back on these memories to feel meaningful and just a bit slower. Something i look back on lovingly at a calm pace because it is just a mental place I am comfortable sitting in. My editing will be less frequent clip cutting- and if I am going to do a quick cut it will be something a bit softer. In class last week we went over a few clips and noted that in action shots there were frequent clips during a bank robbery as well as an escape scene- multiple camera angles as well. I am looking at something opposite to this, gentle soft and slow camera angles- so it's kind of like you're skimming back through foggy memories and attempting recollection of thoughts. Perhaps I could find a way to create a light sort of blur without editing as the camera spis to turn and then we enter another clip beginning with that same spinning motion to create a match cut. I will experiment with this just making basic clips at home.

The written intention of my work has remained in strict likeness to the previous weeks descriptions. The general concept of my storyboard is childhood, and how once we close the door to it growing up, we turn around and realise that it will be locked forever. 
My intentions are to
