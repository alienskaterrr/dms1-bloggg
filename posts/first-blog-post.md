Week 1!

Hello there,  and welcome to my blog. To begin I am starting with my first homework task; which includes the below account of my first lesson and scavenger hunt. I was aided by my two group members Matilda and Will who were just lovely and super quick and onto things- seeing as some of the things we needed to find were described in a somewhat cryptic manner. 
I hope this works as I am new to this type of code and will need to better familiarise myself with something like this for future lessons.

Thank you, and enjoy I suppose.

Describing the process of finding itself, we began by reading everything as a group and just having a bit of friendly chit chat- introductions and such. The library was our first spot as we underestimated the difficulty to be had in finding something we thought would be more noticeable; this being the book containing Digital Media wisdom, but I had never visited the library  and so I had imagined a very big sign signalling the media section and so forth, we sort of gave up and decided to search for something easier, coming back later. 
On our way out we found/noticed the draped paper, it sort of looked like a net and so we thought it may have been number three, the wide net strung above; I am still not sure if we were correct or not, but it was convenient and we hadn't noticed any other nets in our time on campus. 
As we moved away from this we glanced to the right and saw the study area worthy of a dark sith. Something about the mirroring pods seemed like a death star slowly opening to reveal a lightsaber fight or a dormant Lord waiting for someone to come challenge them- we all agreed on this, and so we confidently ticked that one off. 
The hands were also quite obvious, seeing as they are alone in being the only two disembodied hands and extremely ape-like. Walking across from this to the little alley leading to the basketball courts we noticed signage pointing to the old gaol and sort of drew the correlation between that and condemned seeing as prisoners aren't the most well-like members of society. The door, once found, was definitely the one as in the short description seen in the background of our selfie we noted the word condemned was included in the passage. 
The golden globe atop of a tower of eights was also semi obvious as it is one of a kind and quite bright when hit by the sun- it was more difficult to get in a photo with all of us but we managed as seen below.
The explosive cup of coffee sort of had us a bit confused at first and speculating whether or not it was an art piece in the design area of campus, but then I had recalled the small shop close to the tram stop and made the brief comment about how it could be a metaphor and then Matilda noted on a digital map little bang coffee which confirmed suspicions. It haa a bomb with a cup of coffee in the logo- and so we snapped our next pic.
The wide out of this world vending machine was next, at first we thought it was one found on floor six, with a turtle logo, as it had a wide array of caffienated drinks made on the spot in front of you; very impressive. We did take a photo but then coming back down to the lower floor noticed the extremely large one close to the streaming room and thought it more likely to be our one.
The basement dwelling Blackbox was confusing at first- I thought of the ones found in aircrafts, and wondered if there was a section for people completing bachelors of aviation or aeronautical engineering, but then we wandered the "basement" and found the sign literally reading blackbox and had a sort of "oh" moment quickly followed by a selfie. 
The cultural drape winged friend one was something we thought on for quite a while as we circled popular areas but then matilda scanned the QR code next to the bronze statue and read the lore which revealed its Indigenous connections and something about an eagle which is, obviously, winged. As for the book, well... it probably isn't the right one.

And that is the lovely dragged out tale of our scavenger hunt.

Week 2!

Our homework task for week two is to produce a storyboard on Canvas. This can be found linked below but first I will explain how I plan on maintaining continuity as the second part of our homework task! ðŸ˜‡
Continuity is defined as whether or not things are the same from shot to shot, and how that can impact the realism in regards to storytelling and how immeresed the audience feels as a result of this.
the show I have selected for this storyboard is moon knight; the scene specifically being an action shot in which his suit begins to materialise onto his skin accompanied by a "fwip!" As it sorts of wraps itself onto his skin- there is then a sort of cutaway shot that goes to his counterpart, for context there is two men sharing a body, one mind but a trauma response has led to a sort of schizophrenic type situation, moving back towards the topic; this cutaway follows the other one falling off of a building and the suit quickly forming on his skin- only truly visible in slow motion. I wrote poof to sort of emphasise the quick nature but also how it sort of just appears on him. he then falls indicated by the downwards nature of the arrow and he then lays on the ground momentarily. The cutaway then goes to him standing again brushing himself off- hence why i drew four arms, two being drawing with thinner lines to indicate the flailing movement as he rubs his hands up and down his body to get the dust off. 
This is where I ended it!
Here is the link to the video- it is a clip within a longer one apologies i could not source from the show due to disney plus not enabling recording for obvious copyright reasons
Moon Knight is fully owned by Disney falling underneath the Marvel franchise/merchandise

Lookiing back on this I now see my error- in class I made the mistake of thinking that the storyboard was for any scene, but as I perfect this assessment for submission I note that the storyboard is actually for our project. Which is actually easier in a sense and I am please I can write about it. 
I have decided to begin this storyboard from the time stamp of 19 seconds, when I use a close up shot of my Uncle's grave. This scene is crucial as explained in a passage I wrote further down last week. I thought it would be a good place to start seeing as it is the beginning of the story- he is the reason we moved. In the storyboard I have described it as a still shot, and extreme close up with very light jostling to sort of emphasise the feeling you get when you're not extremely physically reactive but you are beginning to realise the gravity of what has happened, and so carrying that metaphorical weight is beginning to literally move you. This is when the audio begins as it is as aforementioned when the story begins.
The next shot is of the rose planted into his grave, a single one was in bloom and like me it was jostling too- I thought this was a nice small parallel in a way, or a shared emotion of sorts between our two planes of existence. A bit stretched but sometimes you believe in a presence like that even if it is just emotional influence causing it. 
I then used another still shot, but instead of an extreme close up I went an extreme wide shot- as my focus is the mountain, staring at me from the distance almost foreboding or telling me what was to come- where I would live. If you find the middle of the frame you will notice the mountain aligns with it almost perfectly. I thought it would be a nice touch as the mountain is returned to.
The next scene continues the story of his passing influencing our decision to leave, I found a for sale sign with an empty lot. Whilst we did not knock our house down it looks so foreign and different now with age and perspective that it almost feels as though we sold them something that wasn't ours- and so basically nothing in terms of sentimental value. For the choice of audio I selected two sound effects from the Adobe transportation effect pack, the first being a car trunk closing- something we would've heard shortly before leaving our home when it was a home to call ours, and then a car speeding off as we drove away.
This then flows into the next scene of my new backyard, unfortunately I could not find a house with a sold sign in my area as I thought it would've been quite a nice touch. Getting back to the narrative, you can note that I am once more looking out on that same mountain, but from the otherside, it is no longer sunny and replicating my emotions at the time. I couldn't just go back across the mountain, and even if I did it would not longer look the same on the other side. Sort of representing how we feel when looking back on childhood. 
The next scene is not the final for the entire assessment but is the final for this storyboard homework- I try to take a more uplifting point of view here, and show some water. Whilst this is just water from my local lake, it moved in a sort of serene shore like manner and so I selected the rolling waves sound effect from the ambience pack and placed it alongside these clips to show the everyday moments in which I find glimpses of my childhood present.

Storyboard for my self portrait!
The mental/verbal sort of storyboard for my self portrait is that it revolves around nostalgia and sort of missed feelings of childhood etc. it begins just with a quick shot of my yard, some cigarettes and then there is a cutaway shot to some similar weather in which we are now at the beach- my childhood home beach. so essentially a match cut. i had also thought of doing this with a sea shell and will experiment still potentially using this idea- the shell will then appear throughout every scene as i find that every day little things bring me back to past emotions etc because it symbolises me growin up at the beach. obviously this could change as time goes forward but for now that is an idea i keep going back to. 
A little update returning to this days later- I have found my seashell and will refilm about 40 seconds of footage to try to include it as best as I can as a small link between everything as the beach was my home and something we always come back to in a way. i have included a photo of it so that you may look out for it if it isn't as obvious in certain scenes I have yet to film. I have also decided to make a trip to our local cemetery as my Uncle is the reason we ended up moving here and a lot of big things in our life were made possible thanks to him; such as moving here and travelling back and forth between Australia and Canada. I had thoughts of potentially picking up the seashell from his grab in the beginning clip and then having an editing technique that makes it look as though I have been shot back in time- and the whole self portrait is like living in a memory? I must play around with this as I already have footage but I am certain I will be able to incorporate it and twist some things around. 

Yet another update!

Unfortunately due to accessibility issues I am no longer able to make it to the beach at which I used to live. This obviously posed a ginormous issue as the entire direction of the project depended on it in many ways, and I really had to scramble and decide between a first option in which I would come up with an entirely new idea; which is obviously less than ideal seeing as to how much work I had sunk into the whole thought process. My second, which is what I have gone with is to go to the closest body of water near me- a lake, and try to emanate the same feelings from it. This meant that I would not only have to heavily rely on my writing as a back up but sound effects too; things such as the ambience beach sound effects found in Adobe, as well as my ability to find metaphors in the visuals presenting in front of me. 
I immediately visited said lake and began to film as much footage as possible whilst attempting to keep it unique. I have also sort of tweaked my storyline; it will still be a short story of my move and self potrait of feelings but will grow from a sort of sad piece into one of a happier tone; towards the end half of my work I will begin to show things that make me happy, and how sometimes you just need time to come around/get used to something.

For the music; i am looking for something that sort of encapsulates the music of terraria/minecraft, moreso minecraft not only as it is a childhood favourite of mine spent playing with people i love but also because it gives you that sad bittersweetness of not being able to return to what was.
After doing some light investigating as to where I can find good quality copyright free music- I discovered a website called sound stripe. This website did require a sign up but downloads were free and it was secure. I downloaded two tracks, and settled for "Feathered Aurora" containing piano but also some light synth. It sits quite close to the ideal sound I was after- I did need to access it through apple music but fortunately I am a member. I now need to learn how to download it as an audio file, if this isn't possible I could film the sound through a microphone and turn that into one if easier; I just worry the sound quality will turn out lesser but I will experiment nonetheless.

Returning to this! I have found music; the song "Aurora" by Featherland. It is completely copyright free and encapsulates what I am attempting to convey.
As for sound effects, I skimmed through RMITs selection from the link on Canvas and decided on the ambience 2 pack. I used a total of four throughout my project and I think they each fit nicely.

Coming back to this again. I wasn't the most pleased with my music, and so although it is the third last day prior to submission I have replaced it. I searched YouTube for copyright free music and found an artist who uploads copyright free covers/versions of popular video game music. I drifted towards a personal sentimental favourite of mine, The Legend of Zelda, and selected two covered tracks. Neither really have a name from the artist but the songs they are based off are named "Title theme" and "Fairy's fountain". Whilst tweaked slightly they are still close to their original counterparts and have a nice feeling.
I also opted to start the music on the extreme close up of Uncle Damian's grave, as that is when the story begins. I believe I did mention this somewhere but I thought I would clarify again.

Explaining the first effect- I used the sound of rolling waves to sort of show how I see hear and feel my old home in my current home, whenever I see moving water even if in a lake I feel like I am almost at the beach again and just remember that constant sound ticking all throughout my days as well as the smell of the air. This is placed at the time stamp of 42 seconds and goes until 57 seconds. I thought it most fitting here despite the clips of water moving longer as when I am sitting right next to it the proximity sort of amps up the feelings and seeing it clearly is like looking into a mirror of the past in a way.
The next I selected and imported was from the vehicle sound effect pack- it is played at the time stamp of 33 seconds and goes until 38 seconds. I wanted to use the sound of the car starting/moving to represent travel and departure. Elaborating; it is because as soon as my Uncle had passed and we finished his funeral our move was almost immediately after- a fresh start, and so it is supposed to symbolise the swiftness of the change. As the sound fades out we move on to the next clip of my backyard- I waited until the weather was rather mundane for this to sort of replicate the emotions within the household and the apparent lack of appreciation for the sudden living change. I hoped that when I placed in my future clips with the bright sun that it would sort of become a contrast sort of, symbolising how I went from resenting where I lived to seeing some positives in it and the way that it can still remind me of home. Obiviously not being able to get to the beach greatly affected where I was going with this but I thought that it is still water and still something I can use to my advantage as I wasn't fond of the idea in which I'd have to change my entire direction of the project.

Week 2 Session 2!

For this sessions homework I have been tasked with selecting a key moment from my self portrait video that my entire project is likely to depend on. 
I have selected the first scene- which seems cliche but it truly does make the story and help connect each segment without words. 
This scene is a short landscape clip of my Uncle's resting place, just a short one with some light ambience through the nature sounds including wind and local birds. I have decided that I will not add music to these first few seconds as there is a certain peace in it. This then quickly cuts to a seashell in front of him, I will pick this up and it will metaphorically take me back in time to my childhood- something that made me who I am now and tasked me with the challenge of completely starting over in a sense. 

This scene is crucial, as aforementioned it will make the story- this seashell will be with me every step of the way and symbolise my childhod whilst representing how my past is something I come back to in regular everyday life. 

A justification for how I plan on using sound design for this moment is having the first few short clips of 'memories'before the music slowly fades in have similar audios- for example the birds will be the same, since they are common in my area living rurally, I will sample audio clips of different chirps. So when the second and third clips play as I being to reminisce I recall the sound of the birds as I walked along the beach, or a day in my childhood backyard. How those birds at the cemetery are the same, and something consistent. This will keep that flow of sort of past and present connections going. 

The emotional tone of the broader portrait is a bittersweetness- I want to elicit feelings of nostalgia from my audience as they sort of look through my lens, rose coloured glasses as I remember everything good from childhood and how I both do and don't find that to be a part of the everyday living now. Editing choices supporting this will be match cuts- moments that replicate each other so much so that they almost fade into one another as I see those similarities. Fades to black and white will also include this as I will use them to represent past- since we usually correlate black and white with archaic sort of footage and past things in a sense. Perhaps I am looking out into the water for the last time and it fades to black and white. Dissolving techniques will also help this as it's like something melting away in your hand or escpaing/falling far away from you. I could be in the car driving past the water and then the clip dissolves, and as I wake up I am in the country, somewhere new- Currently my grandparents who live close to me have an empty lot next to them, and so I could utilise that for sale sign and have it act as either the empty lot we bought or the empty lot we sold as we said goodbye to an era goneby, our childhood home. 

Something the audience needs to understand as the relationship between each shot is that they are all replicating a sort of chronologial sequence of memories- me growing up to become this person and how influential I found my uncle as a person and the beach as my home to be. It is telling a story without actually telling a story. The connection I want to forge is that where I am now and where I have lived all goes back to my Uncle, he lived at the beach first and we followed, when he was ill he came here as it was his childhood town and again we followed when he passed to sort of be with him without physically being with him. The influence he has had despite my unawareness in the past- something typical of a childs mind, is something that I really want to try and portray. 

The rhythm, tempo and pace I want to establish during this moment are what I would say slow paced. I want looking back on these memories to feel meaningful and just a bit slower. Something i look back on lovingly at a calm pace because it is just a mental place I am comfortable sitting in. My editing will be less frequent clip cutting- and if I am going to do a quick cut it will be something a bit softer. In class last week we went over a few clips and noted that in action shots there were frequent clips during a bank robbery as well as an escape scene- multiple camera angles as well. I am looking at something opposite to this, gentle soft and slow camera angles- so it's kind of like you're skimming back through foggy memories and attempting recollection of thoughts. Perhaps I could find a way to create a light sort of blur without editing as the camera spis to turn and then we enter another clip beginning with that same spinning motion to create a match cut. I will experiment with this just making basic clips at home. 

Week 3 session 1!

A link containing the draft for the self portrait assessment task:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcFMD4t_P3A

The process of creating this draft included collating my clips- sourced at random as I was in desperate search of anything that was a body of water- the cloest thing to a beach I could access with ease. I then began by using some basic copyright free music- but the more I searched, and admittedly put more time/effort into said search, I found sounds much closer to my liking and they just fit the overall feeling better. I seem to have an issue with quality- the video is in 1080p, however it seems to upload as 240p despite my connection being perfect. I must task myself with investigating this.

The written intention of my work has remained in strict likeness to the previous weeks descriptions. The general concept of my storyboard is childhood, and how once we close the door to it growing up, we turn around and realise that it will be locked forever. To introduce it I simply would describe it as a glance back on childhood and how it still peeks through in the present although never fully returning.

Week 3 session 2!

I have just completed a final grammar check and ensured that each link is accessible from the deployed blog when live, and that everything is included!

Thank you for reading :-D
