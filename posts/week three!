Week 3 session 1!

A link containing the draft for the self portrait assessment task:

The process of creating this draft included collating my clips- sourced at random as I was in desperate search of anything that was a body of water- the cloest thing to a beach I could access with ease. I then began by using some basic copyright free music- but the more I searched, and admittedly put more time/effort into said search, I found sounds much closer to my liking and they just fit the overall feeling better. I seem to have an issue with quality- the video is in 1080p, however it seems to upload as 240p despite my connection being perfect. I must task myself with investigating this.

The written intention of my work has remained in strict likeness to the previous weeks descriptions. The general concept of my storyboard is childhood, and how once we close the door to it growing up, we turn around and realise that it will be locked forever. To introduce it I simply would describe it as a glance back on childhood and how it still peeks through in the present although never fully returning.

Week 3 session 2!

I have just completed a final grammar check and ensured that each link is accessible from the deployed blog when live, and that everything is included!

Thank you for reading :-D
