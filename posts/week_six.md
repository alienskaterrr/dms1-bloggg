Week 6 Session 1

I was not in attendance of this session, due to my not ideal distance from campus and transport,
however I could still garner an understanding from the homework task of what happened during class
and obviously what is expected of me.
I just wanted to upload some rough sketches of the sort of idea I have for my nine icons- I have completed 6 now, each with an alternative design, and am still working as diligently as possible
on my final 3. 
Basically I sort of had this idea, that I may have have already mentioned, sorry if this is the case,
that when we look back on a memory there is a haze around it, it is a little bit blurry and something we can't really look back on with true clarity and confidence in understanding. 
I created some brief logos, each extremely poorly translated from an iPad, kind of just as a rough sketch detailing the sort of representation of this.

Currently what I am working with is that the first logo will be a USB for the human's port, each with
something distinctive to the kind of memory it is, and then when the user interacts with it, it will
become something similar to this rough logo design. 
Below I have attached some examples of said USB, this was coincidetally also my first time exploring 
the colour option, somewhat embarrassing but also quite enjoyable. I wasn't really happy with the
differences illustrator had in comparison to MS paint as I was comfortable with certain features, 
however after practice and practice I have become much more confident and am excited to see where my
ideas take me for my last few final designs and how much they will convey my idea, standing alone
without my writings to back them up.

I have officially finished my nine icons- or eighteen rather as they must change when clicked on.
I have placed my first one in this blog as an example, the USB being what each icon is presented as
first and the portal what comes after. I ended changing my designs to be the following themes under
the overarching theme of "memory"

- Sadness
- Passion
- Place
- Emotion
- Childhood
- Identity
- Relationships
- Experiences
- Glory

These are quite different to my original ideas but I just found some of them so hard to represent 
visually, and whilst it is good to challenge ones self I did not want to end up with something I was
disappointed in. I have collated some notes for each to explain the designs and why I went with the
aspects, apologies if the descriptions sounds clunky- I opted to record a voice memo each time I 
completed one, as I wanted my notes fresh in my head and explained through my own voice. I also
find when speaking aloud things seem to come to me quicker.

For icon number one:
I chose sadness, as when I started my icons a while ago I was having trouble narrowing down emotion into
one design- something I later fixed but that is not our current topic. I opted for dark tones using both
purple and blue as the main colours- this was my first time exploring Adobe's true capabilities, and so
this design features things such as the outline, gradience, shaping tools, free hand designs etc.
I began by doing some simple tears, and I used a different shape and colour for each to symbolise 
different types of sadness. I then triggered the outline tool by mistake, and started to just draw
random lines around the page and decided that perhaps I could use integrate it into my design- so
I did layers of tears, at first I feared it would be chaotic as we mentioned in class the differences
to be had in a detailed vs busy/chaotic design, but I also wanted to really learn Adobe to the best of
my ability as I knew I'd be using it for the rest of my designs. Once I had completed that, I did some
more simple tears below with the outline and fill tool. I then attempted some free draw on a spare 
page, as I did not want to ruin my design and then find difficulty in erasing my mistakes. Once I
realised that Adobe could correct/smooth out lines drawn, and recalled the ability to move around the
points of my design, I very slowly did a blue wave- "awash with tears" being my inspiration, I pulled
some of the points around and ended up quite pleased with the final result. After this I tested my hand
at the gradient tool and decided to play around with like magic coming out of the USB- quite absurd but
I suppose also fitted to a universe where people are born with USB ports on their body.. anyways, I 
then had to move on to the portal, or "memory" rather being simulated and stimulated by the USB. I was
sort of playing around with the idea of tears to being with, and completed a border of tears, and then \
the portal effect just free hand with a bunch of different colours under the main two I'd been using-
blue and purple, with some miscellaneous ones thrown in. For the main feature I was still torn, and
so I just started verbally spitballing ideas with a friend, bouncing off one another, and we came to
the conclusion that heartbreak elicits intense and deep sadness as you've esentially lost such a large
portion of your affection and joy, you've lost someone to share things with. I wanted it to look kind 
of fancy and so I decided to use an anatomically accurate heart, with an inaccurate colour scheme though
obviously, and added some patterns as I linked all of my icons through dotted patterns and waves. I then
created my best depiction of some glass shards about to puncture the heart using free hand and then a
crack running throughout the background showing the shattering. I finished it with some more of the
magic sort of cloud haze.
