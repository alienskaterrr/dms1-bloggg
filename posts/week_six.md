Week 6 Session 1

I was not in attendance of this session, due to my not ideal distance from campus and transport,
however I could still garner an understanding from the homework task of what happened during class
and obviously what is expected of me.
I just wanted to upload some rough sketches of the sort of idea I have for my nine icons- I have completed 6 now, each with an alternative design, and am still working as diligently as possible
on my final 3. 
Basically I sort of had this idea, that I may have have already mentioned, sorry if this is the case,
that when we look back on a memory there is a haze around it, it is a little bit blurry and something we can't really look back on with true clarity and confidence in understanding. 
I created some brief logos, each extremely poorly translated from an iPad, kind of just as a rough sketch detailing the sort of representation of this.

Currently what I am working with is that the first logo will be a USB for the human's port, each with
something distinctive to the kind of memory it is, and then when the user interacts with it, it will
become something similar to this rough logo design. 
Below I have attached some examples of said USB, this was coincidetally also my first time exploring 
the colour option, somewhat embarrassing but also quite enjoyable. I wasn't really happy with the
differences illustrator had in comparison to MS paint as I was comfortable with certain features, 
however after practice and practice I have become much more confident and am excited to see where my
ideas take me for my last few final designs and how much they will convey my idea, standing alone
without my writings to back them up.
