Week 6 Session 1

I was not in attendance of this session, due to my not ideal distance from campus and transport,
however I could still garner an understanding from the homework task of what happened during class
and obviously what is expected of me.
I just wanted to upload some rough sketches of the sort of idea I have for my nine icons- I have completed 6 now, each with an alternative design, and am still working as diligently as possible
on my final 3. 
Basically I sort of had this idea, that I may have have already mentioned, sorry if this is the case,
that when we look back on a memory there is a haze around it, it is a little bit blurry and something we can't really look back on with true clarity and confidence in understanding. 
I created some brief logos, each extremely poorly translated from an iPad, kind of just as a rough sketch detailing the sort of representation of this.
