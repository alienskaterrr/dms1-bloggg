Week 6 Session 1

I was not in attendance of this session, due to my not ideal distance from campus and transport,
however I could still garner an understanding from the homework task of what happened during class
and obviously what is expected of me.
I just wanted to upload some rough sketches of the sort of idea I have for my nine icons- I have completed 6 now, each with an alternative design, and am still working as diligently as possible
on my final 3. 
Basically I sort of had this idea, that I may have have already mentioned, sorry if this is the case,
that when we look back on a memory there is a haze around it, it is a little bit blurry and something we can't really look back on with true clarity and confidence in understanding. 
I created some brief logos, each extremely poorly translated from an iPad, kind of just as a rough sketch detailing the sort of representation of this.

Currently what I am working with is that the first logo will be a USB for the human's port, each with
something distinctive to the kind of memory it is, and then when the user interacts with it, it will
become something similar to this rough logo design. 
Below I have attached some examples of said USB, this was coincidetally also my first time exploring 
the colour option, somewhat embarrassing but also quite enjoyable. I wasn't really happy with the
differences illustrator had in comparison to MS paint as I was comfortable with certain features, 
however after practice and practice I have become much more confident and am excited to see where my
ideas take me for my last few final designs and how much they will convey my idea, standing alone
without my writings to back them up.

I have officially finished my nine icons- or eighteen rather as they must change when clicked on.
I have placed my first one in this blog as an example, the USB being what each icon is presented as
first and the portal what comes after. I ended changing my designs to be the following themes under
the overarching theme of "memory"

- Sadness
- Passion
- Place
- Emotion
- Childhood
- Identity
- Relationships
- Experiences
- Glory

These are quite different to my original ideas but I just found some of them so hard to represent 
visually, and whilst it is good to challenge ones self I did not want to end up with something I was
disappointed in. I have collated some notes for each to explain the designs and why I went with the
aspects, apologies if the descriptions sounds clunky- I opted to record a voice memo each time I 
completed one, as I wanted my notes fresh in my head and explained through my own voice. I also
find when speaking aloud things seem to come to me quicker.

For icon number one:
I chose sadness, as when I started my icons a while ago I was having trouble narrowing down emotion into
one design- something I later fixed but that is not our current topic. I opted for dark tones using both
purple and blue as the main colours- this was my first time exploring Adobe's true capabilities, and so
this design features things such as the outline, gradience, shaping tools, free hand designs etc.
I began by doing some simple tears, and I used a different shape and colour for each to symbolise 
different types of sadness. I then triggered the outline tool by mistake, and started to just draw
random lines around the page and decided that perhaps I could use integrate it into my design- so
I did layers of tears, at first I feared it would be chaotic as we mentioned in class the differences
to be had in a detailed vs busy/chaotic design, but I also wanted to really learn Adobe to the best of
my ability as I knew I'd be using it for the rest of my designs. Once I had completed that, I did some
more simple tears below with the outline and fill tool. I then attempted some free draw on a spare 
page, as I did not want to ruin my design and then find difficulty in erasing my mistakes. Once I
realised that Adobe could correct/smooth out lines drawn, and recalled the ability to move around the
points of my design, I very slowly did a blue wave- "awash with tears" being my inspiration, I pulled
some of the points around and ended up quite pleased with the final result. After this I tested my hand
at the gradient tool and decided to play around with magic coming out of the USB- quite absurd but
I suppose also fitted to a universe where people are born with USB ports on their body.. anyways, I 
then had to move on to the portal, or "memory" rather being simulated and stimulated by the USB. I was
sort of playing around with the idea of tears to begin with, and completed a border of tears, and then
the portal effect just with my free hand with a bunch of different colours under the main two I'd been using- blue and purple, with some miscellaneous ones thrown in. For the main feature I was still torn, and so I just started verbally spitballing ideas with a friend, bouncing off one another, and we came to
the conclusion that heartbreak elicits intense and deep sadness as you've esentially lost such a large
portion of your affection and joy, you've lost someone to share things with. I wanted it to look kind 
of fancy and so I decided to use an anatomically accurate heart, with an inaccurate colour scheme though
obviously, and added some patterns as I linked all of my icons through dotted patterns and waves. I then
created my best depiction of some glass shards about to puncture the heart using free hand and then a
crack running throughout the background showing the shattering. I finished it with some more of the
magic sort of cloud haze.

For icon number two:
I was sort of following my first design for this second one; the theme being a memory of passion. I 
decided to follow a sort of metaphorical meaning route by using flames and lightning bolts, representing
flames/sparks of passion. I used an opposite colour scheme selecting very neon tones, and I again used
free hand, just drawing flames wherever I found them fit. Being completely honest I am not truly happy 
with the first element of this design- I dislike how it isn't as symmetrical as the first one, but it
could just be that I dislike it in comparison. Not too much thought went into the design addmitedly,
however I am proud of my second design for this theme. I went with the flames again, drawing the sun as
my centre piece- I used the dreamy hazy sort of border again and attempted to do some flames coming out
from within it as well, but I honestly see them as kelp-esque sort of designs. I did attempt to refine
and go over them but it was hard to achieve what I wanted visually and so I practiced acceptance and 
moved on. I opted for flames as the external detail keeping my theme of burning passionate reccuring 
and finished it with some lines swirling out of the sun because I felt it empty. Overall I'm not 
swooning over this one but it is visually pleasing disregarding little things.




For icon number three:
This icon is based on a memory of a place/places. I went with green for a sort of earthy colour, as I
wanted to draw a correlation with the green of countries on the globe. I started off with some small
mountains, and then drew little red lines for a path showing all the places people go throughout
their life, pretty straightforward. I then kept the dot pattern going to ensure all of my designs
are linked. Since I had used the green, I decided to do a splash of water on the other side, and
popped a small stamp in it's centre, again to keep thematical accuracy- as words were not an option.
For the second side of the icon, the portal, I began with the border, using earthy tones stemming from
the base colours of brown and green, I created a range of mountains- looking back I wish I'd made them
larger, as not only would it have been less time consuming, but better suited to the demanding size of
the circle. For the centre I was contemplating between different natural terrains, but since these
are supposed to be memories for purchase in the world/story I have created, a multitide of different
people would be buying them, each having gone to different places, with different meanings and
connections. So I opted for a map, using the marker icon found on most digital maps, and then four 
different patches of blue surrounding to represent different seas/oceans etc. Slightly different in
terms of colour choice to my other icons, but it still does it's job regardless.




For icon number four:
I came back to emotion for this icon, and whilst I was skeptical having already done two specific 
emotions, I decided to give it a chance as I didn't want to continue using specific emotions only,
I wanted broad ideas of what a memory elicits/is about. Getting back onto topic, I decided to draw
sort of jester masks, each with an opposite behind it. The first pair being happy and sad, the second
angry and calm, the third depressed and ecstatic, and the fourth jealousy and acceptance. I also
drew a little cave system through the middle of the USB, sort of representing how you navigate emotional
twists and turns. For the secondary icon, I drew a stage, with a ball of emotions on display, split into
four sections, as often emotional reactions are met with attention, I drew yellow lights showing people
and thoughts in the audience. This icon sort of differed to the past three I'd done, and so I again felt
it sort of visually inadequate, but I also know that it is imporant to have them be different and to 
really explore every feature of Illustrator available to us.




For icon number five:
This icon's theme is childhood. I loved my childhood, and my parents often tell me that people look 
back on childhood through a "rose coloured lens" or something along those lines, and so I actually
implemented roses into my design. For the USB I drew a large rose on the left side, and on the right
a thorny stem with the typical patterned dots alongside it to keep everything inteconnected. This
I am happy with, however I am much more pleased with the second part of the icon. I began with the 
border, using bright colours to show an exciting childhood with lots of little bumps, against a super
bright background. I then started off with a hand extended outwards, and in it's palm is a huge
rose sort of growing from within it, bushy greens growing up the arm and vines falling off of it with
some bright spores. I think it is definitely reaching, and of course I note that not everyone had a 
pleasant childhood. It is also quite hypocritical as earlier I chose to do just a map because everyone
had been to different places, so I probably should have used a more general symbol of youthful times,
but I feel strongly for my childhood and found this a nice personal touch and direction to go in.




For icon number six:
This icon is based on identity. This was actually quite challenging, as when you remember triumphs
in your life relating to identity everyone is shaped by such different things, like hobbies sexuality
culture gender etc. I did attempt to start off my entire assessment with identity, and I had the odd
idea to use the colour scheme of the Australian passport, as I always use it as my identifying 
document. But not everyone is Australian, and not everyone has a passport, so I sort of left this until
last, almost. Coming back to it I tried to think about things relating to identity and how people
view themselves and what forms an identity- and then I actually pictured a mirror and thought it may be
a cool idea. I started off with the memory icon instead of the USB icon for this one. I began with a 
mirror in the centre, and then found it to be in likeness with an eye, so I gave it a pupil and added
some sparks to it- because I feel that sometimes when you see something that is so uniquely you
it sort of sets off a spark and you make it a part of your identity, I did complete a border in some
areas but not across the full perimeter. I then moved onto the USB and drew two mirrors. One has a
border lacking any colour, and the other bordered with vibrant colours, the first being  person before
they have found their sparks and then second someone who has found sparks and formed an identity. 
I then drew some messy colourless lines within the first mirror to show the sort of mess and loss 
someone might experience if they are void of an identity, or confusion as they look for one. The
second mirror has more structured lines, each a different colour, representing the opposite. 
Sparks and a clock spin between each showing time and how it is a large factor, as a true identity
doesn't come quickly.




For icon number seven:
This icon represents relationships. For the design of the USB, I drew two twin flames connecting with
one another, and then silhouettes within connecting as well. For the secondary icon I did two cords 
connecting with some more flames moving outwards from them showing flourishment and growth within a
relationship. I then went with the typical dream border and dots. This design is arguably my most
thoughtless and whilst not terrible it does stand out a bit against the rest for the wrong reasons.




For icon number eight:
This icon is for experiences, I drew a ticket on the USB and four symbols of generic, but also random
in their own regard, things such as a heartbreak, a grad cap, a book and a plane for things that people
have done across their life. I then drew four paths coming out of the ticket to represent how 
experiences shape people and take you in life. The portal afterwards has four different sections with
one line traversing the entire cricle, on this line different dots are placed for destinations and
places people will go and things they will do across their life and how it sort of changes their path
through different imprints. 




For icon number nine:
My final icon is quite random, I impulsively chose glory, as I thought what if in the society I have
created for this assignment- each memory is priced, with sadness being the least expensive, as who wants
to experience sadness, and glory being the most expensive- but when you finally purchase glory it
merely has a congratulatory phrase with a star on it, something to flex rather than to experience.
So I went completely different with my design thinking for this and took a direction in which this icon
looks as though it could be a tacky logo for a product of sorts. I am pleased with it however I do
worry it isn't as connected to the others as I might like.

For audio, I want something reflective of the Nintendo DSi camera soundtrack, or nature sound effects
depending on which icon it is, I have not decided yet but plan on skimming the copyright free sound
effects available to us through canvas. Updating- I have selected some sound effects from Adobe's ambience pack and have now completed my assessment, following the instructions featured in the link from our homework task. 

I have also attached images of all of my icons to pair with their descriptions.
