This week we began our second assessment task, creating nine interactive icons underneath a chosen 
theme. Since we were told
to get creative with it, I opted for a scenario in which my user is someone in a later life stage, 
so considered "old". For my theme I selected "memory". My setting for the digital space will be a 
supermarket, or just any store, set in a futuristic sort of sci-fi world in which humans can feel 
emotions/memories they may have missed out on through purchasing USBs that they can plug into ports 
on their body- the interface in which the user can click on these icons will either be the shelf, 
where each are for sale- maybe one is an emotion pack, another places, another a person and then 
others I decide as I go along. My other idea for the interface was that they were all in the trolley 
ready for purchase, and that the user is looking down into their trolley with consideration deciding 
which to buy/look at. 

For our first homework task, we downloaded Adobe Illustrator and used a provided template for a black 
squares activity. We were provided themes, thr first being order, the second increase, then bold, 
congested, tension and playful. We then had to use no more than four black squares to create a visual 
represenation of what we interpreted each as, for example increase being four squares each getting 
larger. The videos were a great help as whilst each Adobe interface is similar the features differ- 
valuable tips included the V shortcut enabling the mini task bar, something introduced in 2024, as 
well as panels on the right side that are collapsible and expandible. 
To zoom with ease you can select an icon and press the command key and plus- at least for mac, it 
differs for windows. It zooms in slowly in increments and if you wish to zoom out command minus will 
slowyl pull your focus away from it. 
Command 0 allows perfect focus on the entire document so you can see everything perfectly in frame and 
with good quality. Command 1 will fit to 100%. 
Z is the main shortcut for zooming in. If an animated zoom is not your preference, it may be disabled 
in settings, and so to zoom all you must do is click and drag to create an area of focus and then hit 
Z for an instantaneous zoom in on whatever your desire. 
Clicking H provides the hand tool allowing for a click and drag with ease. Command and spacebar are 
also capable of an instantaneous zoom if you select an area and use them. 
Shift and H will trigger the rotate tool, useful for spinning not only your point of view but the 
entire piece you find yourself working on- it was also pointed out that the track pad is an easier 
way to do this. Hitting the esc button will revert your point of view. 
Holding down the shift key will allow you to add to your current selection, and can be easily 
subtracted at anytime using it once more.
Pressing A triggers the shortcut for the direct selection tool, useful for touching up on the anchor 
points of an object. 
Pressing Q enables the lasso tool, which allows you to drag lines to whatever shape you like- useful 
for selecting anchor points that are not always accessible. 
Command 0 triggers the magic wand tool.
Everything on illustrator has a hidden ID that Illustrator uses to identify what you are currently 
selecting and working on. This means that even when something undergoes a visual change, ranging from 
colour to size, it is still just the same to illustrator and you can still group together objects of 
the same origin. 
You can also create a selection- which esentially groups together things you are working on underneath 
a title of your choosing, so that you may select groups of items at a time with ease and know exactly 
which ones Illustrator is meaning. 
Each member of the shape family is underneath a different shortcut, M for rectangle, constrained 
shapes with shift and drag, holding option and drag with create a shape from the direct centre of the 
document if known/not known, the elipse tool with L, using the direct selection tool allows you to 
change individual corners/anchor points, clicking alt whilst in direct selection mode will change the 
corners to one of three modes, polygons and stars have no shortcut and so need to be individually 
selected from the shapes on the left side panel. Selecting up and down on the arrow keys will change 
the number of sides your shape has going up and down. Three is the minimum and eleven the maximum. 
Hitting the black slash / is the shortcut to the line tool.
