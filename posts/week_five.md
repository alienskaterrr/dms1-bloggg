Week 5 Session 1!

This week, we were assigned a homework task which put an emphasis on improving our Adobe Illustrator
skills. Last week we completed a task in which we completed 20 icons for a logo, so alternative logos
to my understanding. My selection was Instagram's logo.
We are returning to these this week, and using Adobe Illustrator to create digital counterparts for them, using different hues of one colour for each, only editing saturation and value. Each time we are to add another hue until we feel there is an excessive amount. A minimum of four icons must be completed, obviously the maximum being 20. I have set myself a goal of 10 for now, as it puts me halfway, and so when I feel I can complete the rest I will return to it. We should end up with an estimated 16 colour variations. We must complete it in the Digital Flat style. 

We have been advised to reflect on which colour schemes will work best with our icons and why. I
actually found myself slightly apprehensive instead of jumping right into selection as I had sort of
anticipated unlimited colour usage, however limits are helpful and it is important to follow structure.
I am thinking of beginning with a simple blue, or a grey, as I feel they are easy to manipulate and sort
of fit any picture, they aren't mundane per say but they are definitely malleable as far as colours go. 

I have attached two images for this weeks homework task, the first being the uncoloured version of my 10 icons translated digitally, the second being said icons however with their respective hues.
