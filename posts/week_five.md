Week 5 Session 1!

This week, we were assigned a homework task which put an emphasis on improving our Adobe Illustrator
skills. Last week we completed a task in which we completed 20 icons for a logo, so alternative logos
to my understanding. My selection was Instagram's logo.
We are returning to these this week, and using Adobe Illustrator to create digital counterparts for them, using different hues of one colour for each, only editing saturation and value. Each time we are to add another hue until we feel there is an excessive amount. A minimum of four icons must be completed, obviously the maximum being 20. I have set myself a goal of 10 for now, as it puts me halfway, and so when I feel I can complete the rest I will return to it. We should end up with an estimated 16 colour variations. We must complete it in the Digital Flat style. 

We have been advised to reflect on which colour schemes will work best with our icons and why. I
actually found myself slightly apprehensive instead of jumping right into selection as I had sort of
anticipated unlimited colour usage, however limits are helpful and it is important to follow structure.
I am thinking of beginning with a simple blue, or a grey, as I feel they are easy to manipulate and sort
of fit any picture, they aren't mundane per say but they are definitely malleable as far as colours go. 

I have attached two images for this weeks homework task, the first being the uncoloured version of my 10 icons translated digitally, the second being said icons however with their respective hues.

Week 5 Session 2!

Being completely truthful, I find myself returning to this in Week 7 as I complete some blog maintenance
as well as begin to write the homework task for today's session. 

Revisiting the context for my assesment's digital world/story, it is to be set in a world where humans
have ports on their body, and if they wish to stimulate a certain emotion, experience or memory they
are able to purchase a USB from retailers to plug into themself in an attempt to feel. The same as in
our world, people are of different social and financial standings, the less money you have the worse
the USB you can afford- for example, someone of low class could only purchase sadness or anger, 
memories involving the death of a loved one or some scarring traumatic experience. However, if you were
in the upper class of society you purchase a wide array of positive and fun USBs such as glory or a
relationship, things that make you feel good. Prices of USBs are also reflective of their length; 
meaning that you may only be able to afford a quick 30 seconds if poor, and on the opposite side of
wealth you could purchase hours of fulfilling and positive experiences. There are tiers to USBs as well,
the top USB of the highest tier being glory- a full day of emotion and memories revolving around you,
being placed in a world where you are the most important person in the world, receiving constant
praise and being infinitely rich with no problems in sight. This USB is also special in that you
must prove you are of a salary capable of making such a grand purchase- I have not converted AUD
to whatever hypothetical currency is used in this world, but imagine the highest price you'd think
possible for something so small- this shouldn't be too hard considering the economy we live in today,
but where these people live it is a surprise. People of lower salaries are often accused of criminal
activity when attempting to purchase USBs such as this one, as they are practically impossible to obtain
until you have recieved many qualifications. 
Citizens ID cards each state their place of residence, like ours, however each has a different symbol
reflective of the area's nature, for example, IDs of people living in Frankston would likely be
adorned by a skull. 

Below are the results of the html files in Visual Studio Code :-D
