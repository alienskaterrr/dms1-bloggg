Week seven session one!

Today marks the beginning of our third assessment task- I am quite taken aback by how fast time seems
to be moving within this course. The task dictates we are to create a transformation within unity- or an
environment representing one. We began with a small demonstration on how to create/implement a 3D object
and further apply a material to it. Of course I had to go with Sonic the Hedgehog, only the finest of
pngs. I explored with different shapes and quickly realised that horizontal/rectangular shapes work best
for spherical shapes as well as triangles- as I had applied multiple Sonic character pngs to shapes and
often they had a corrupted/incomplete look as they attempted to wrap around the full size of the
objects. 

After this, we were tasked with completing the solar system- whilst not completely perfect/accurate I
did manage to succeed in making each planet- even pluto until I remembered that we don't mess with pluto
or his gang, then I promptly learnt how to delete an item and removed him from the solar system. 
I had some trouble with even object placement in the sense that each was on a higher/lower ground to
another, and was then informed that by typing a height into the Y section I could easily manipulate
each objects placement on the map and have them all at an equal level. I just used 0 as it is the most
simple to type in. My next question was a bit too early in the lesson- likely a result of my impatience,
as I was curious regarding the ground/surface, and how we would make it. I was then shown by Mx that it
is simply a matter of a right click under the hierarchy, and selection of the terrain option. 

This concluded the lesson for us.

Homework tasks!

For this lesson we were instructed to watch the first three training videos of Unity, to help us
familiarise ourselves with Unity and its interfaces, as well as get on that XP grind like a boss, of
course an essential part of the process.

Returning to my aforementioned description of the assessment task, it must be based on a transformative
experience we have undergone in our lives. I find this something that is hard to place my finger on 
because in some ways it was moving here- returning back to the origins behind my first assessment task,
and in others it was those smaller accumulating things like the people beside me and experiences I have
undergone both good and bad. 

I have ultimately decided to select moving here; as it completely changed the direction of my life,
regarding academics, relationships, hobbies, and overall any/all personality shaping events. Whilst I
did move from one
