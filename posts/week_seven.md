Week seven session one!

Today marks the beginning of our third assessment task- I am quite taken aback by how fast time seems
to be moving within this course. The task dictates we are to create a transformation within unity- or an
environment representing one. We began with a small demonstration on how to create/implement a 3D object
and further apply a material to it. Of course I had to go with Sonic the Hedgehog, only the finest of
pngs. I explored with different shapes and quickly realised that horizontal/rectangular shapes work best
for spherical shapes as well as triangles- as I had applied multiple Sonic character pngs to shapes and
often they had a corrupted/incomplete look as they attempted to wrap around the full size of the
objects. 

After this, we were tasked with completing the solar system- whilst not completely perfect/accurate I
did manage to succeed in making each planet- even pluto until I remembered that we don't mess with pluto
or his gang, then I promptly learnt how to delete an item and removed him from the solar system. 
I had some trouble with even object placement in the sense that each was on a higher/lower ground to
another, and was then informed that by typing a height into the Y section I could easily manipulate
each objects placement on the map and have them all at an equal level. I just used 0 as it is the most
simple to type in. My next question was a bit too early in the lesson- likely a result of my impatience,
as I was curious regarding the ground/surface, and how we would make it. I was then shown by Mx that it
is simply a matter of a right click under the hierarchy, and selection of the terrain option. 

This concluded the lesson for us.

Homework tasks!

For this lesson we were instructed to watch the first three training videos of Unity, to help us
familiarise ourselves with Unity and its interfaces, as well as get on that XP grind like a boss, of
course an essential part of the process.

Returning to my aforementioned description of the assessment task, it must be based on a transformative
experience we have undergone in our lives. I find this something that is hard to place my finger on 
because in some ways it was moving here- returning back to the origins behind my first assessment task,
and in others it was those smaller accumulating things like the people beside me and experiences I have
undergone both good and bad. 

I have ultimately decided to select moving to a rural area from a coastal one as my transformation; as it completely changed the direction of my life, regarding academics, relationships, hobbies, and
overall any/all personality shaping events. I will  attempt to convey this through the entryway being
on a hill of sand with a door adorned by small shells and such, perhaps I will attach an audio asset to
this entryway as well in which some beach sound effects play- I will source these from the Adobe
Ambience pack. 

Some assets I believe I will need for this project include coastal themed pieces, even something as
little as some seashells and sea grass, moving into larger things such as hay and farm land. We
have been made aware of a resource titled sketch fab, and whilst we have yet to fully begin the
process of sourcing set assets I will continue to keep my eye on it. I have already saved the links
to some assets I am certain I will be able to use. 

I want to try and capture the silence in some areas to represent the sort of isolation you feel when
being displaced from your original home to somewhere completely new. I feel that having the beginning
of my map quite busy in terms of sound and environment could help with this, as creating a unique
entrance provides an opportunity to curate the moment. This will then eventually fade into country
terrain, and whilst I will still utilise many assets as well as the terrain feature to create
something detailed I want the audio to be a bit lesser, with MP4s attached only to certain things and
little moments where the user takes a wander in an area with some silence interrupted by the occasional
sound of wind moving through the hills. 

We have been instructed to create either a digital or traditional map of how the user should move 
through our space and a visual representation of said space, ensuring to include landmarks or
things that must be seen by the user to help not only guide them but make sense of the overarching
story/theme present. I have attached this below



Week Seven Session 2!

Today we completed a little wayfinding task. Our group was assigned the task of finding Mx Capogreco's 
favourite spot for some Korean food. This was to teach us about signifiers, and how we orient ourselves
when searching for something. Of course with correlations to digital environments.

Before departing we had a minute to group together and have a brief scan of google maps just to get an
idea of where we were heading, as we were not permitted to use our phones during the search outside of
RMIT itself. The restaurant is called "By Korea", and we used landmarks and prominent signage as our
main means of finding it. We knew that we had to cross the road towards the state library, and further
pass it as well as all of QV's entrances along the way. We then looked out for the sign of the store
itself finding it sticking out of a little alleyway.

The significance this held in relation to our Unity environment is using certain means to guide a user
where you want them to go. The presentation we viewed in class included ways to do this, the most
prominent example being thresholds; often paired with paths, strategically placed alongside them to
help guide the player to an objective. An example of this that came to mind for me is Dracozu Lake in
The Legend of Zelda, found in both BOTW and TOTK, two separate games for context. At this destination
you can find little markers along the water, guiding you into caves to find armour but also your final
objective. 

We were advised to think of ways we can do this in our assessment, whilst keeping within our overarching
theme. I believe I am going to start with using some beach assets, as well as beach ambience MP4s
attached to said assets and surroundings. I will then utilise proximity sound to make it so that they
get more quiet as the player goes forward along the path, and that some rural ambience sounds being to
play and get louder. I will also have a path of course but if done correctly I believe this could also
help as when you hear something different, something that stands out, often it can be a good audio
marker hinting to the user where to go. I will workshop this and continue to document changes and new
ideas.
