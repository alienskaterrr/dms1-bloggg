Week 8 Session 1!

This week marks my first of my new class! It seems I am slightly ahead however I doubt that will be the
case for long as I still feel I have a bit to learn. Currently we are focusing on creating our
greybox prototypes so that we may be ready to play test and import our final assets. I re-familiarised
myself with the terrain tool after clarifying how to paint layers and used upwards of six different
textures to create different paths/areas not only to create a piece of realism but ensure I could
guide my user in a more subtle manner after our lesson on wayfinding. I also learnt how to prevent
assets from being walked all the way through, as collision will help make sure that the user isn't
able to skip important landmarks in my work. 

I have created an account for SketchFab, and further selected a list of ten assets I know I will require
for my project. I have begun with simple nature based ones, to help the realistic aspect of the map 
prosper, but also things such as boxes and a moving truck as I am still focusing on the overarching
story/theme I want to present to my user as they traverse the space. It seems that I am having trouble
deciding on what types of mountains//hills I want for my project, I have developed a rough shape but I
am struggling to really settle on something that pleases me, my next comment is likely reflective of
my skill, but I am finding the raise/lower terrain tool quite temperamental. It seems to be quick to 
create a messy wave of tall mountains or clumps of risen ground in an instant, and so I constantly
find myself having to go back and erase, only to notice that there are odd chunks and bumps left from
the eraser too. I will of course have to workshop this and perhaps watch some videos or practice in a
separate scene to help develop/refine my skill. 

Below are some asset examples I have either already added/looked into.



I have included screenshots of my work so far below. Ignore my hideously unorganised hierarchy. 





Week 8 Session 2!

This class was my first in person class, and I found it really enjoyable. The class has a great sense of
humour and whilst it is still an academic setting I found it comfortable. I learnt how to access 
SketchFab within Unity per a github code provided to us. I began downloading assets immediately; being
careful to only select ones titled either low or medium poly, to prevent lag within my realm; I have
mentioned this above however I have since switched/moved some assets. The homework task for this week
instructs us to select audio for our experience, and so I have begun to browse copyright free audio
from my favourite collection; the Adobe Ambience pack. 

For my audio, I am aiming for beach sounds as well as sort of verbal ones like laughter, but with an
effect overtop of it to make it echo, as it is supposed to be like living in a memory of something
where the sound isn't too obvious as your mind struggles to piece everything together. Basic sounds
include seagulls, waves rolling, some light wind, and as the user slowly walks out of the sandy area
some less happy verbal audio clips, to sort of represent the move/transformation and the apprehension
that comes with being forced to pick up your life and move it after a death. 
I feel that it would be effective to have a slight silence in the gap between the beach and countryside
marked not only by the textures on the ground being a mixture of sand and grass, but also by this sort 
of barren area where there is a lack of assets and an abandoned moving truck paired with empty boxes. 
I found that I thought a lot about hypotheticals revolving around "what if we never moved? what if
something happened that stopped us or changed my parents minds?" I want this to sort of feel like that,
just an empty sort of sad spot. 
After this, I will begin with light ambience sounds including birds as well as nature rustling, I am not
yet 100% confident in my MP4 implementation and tweaking skills, however I would like to make these
sort of quiet, having them get louder as the user goes along, and some happier more lighthearted assets
and audio as well as acceptance is presented to the user. This could also be experienced as a sort of 
numb feeling as well, or a quiet sort of "if I have to be here I will" feeling, however I would prefer
if it were more on the joyous side. 
When I moved to the country I did find certain things I liked and now having lived there for almost a 
decade I find myself so fond of those early days; particularly the quiet serenity of such a low 
resident count, as well as the idea of a fresh start despite being a young child, and finding myself
with like-minded people in terms of interests- certain sports not dominating social hierarchies and
being closer to my only two blood related relatives in this country. 

I am sure this will not be easy to convey to the user, as it is such a personal as well as specific
transformation that I obviously cannot just say, but I can certainly find little ways. An idea I had
was downloading assets related to my hobbies, such as a console, TV, papers and pencils scattered, 
and then placing them around the entrace. Each of these will have the laughter asset and other copy
right free sounds such as a pencil scratching paper or maybe some cheap random beeping sound effects
coming from the console. I will then place the boxes in the rural section, representing the other half
of my transformation and where I found myself, but I will place them as though I have just pulled them
out of storage and boxes, using light effects to place "dust" on them. Very light laughter sound effects
will come from these objects, and will be a reminder that whilst I did leave a place behind I am still
left with memories even if bittersweet, and that they will always be a part of my identity and follow
me into my future. Obviously I will not use just those assets, but I find it a great starting place and
something to follow up on in my process as I feel it will help me get my ideas across.

I am going to test MP4 connections tonight and play around with some audios/ideas. I hope this idea
proves successful.
