Week 8 Session 1!

This week marks my first of my new class! It seems I am slightly ahead however I doubt that will be the
case for long as I still feel I have a bit to learn. Currently we are focusing on creating our
greybox prototypes so that we may be ready to play test and import our final assets. I re-familiarised
myself with the terrain tool after clarifying how to paint layers and used upwards of six different
textures to create different paths/areas not only to create a piece of realism but ensure I could
guide my user in a more subtle manner after our lesson on wayfinding. I also learnt how to prevent
assets from being walked all the way through, as collision will help make sure that the user isn't
able to skip important landmarks in my work. 

I have created an account for SketchFab, and further selected a list of ten assets I know I will require
for my project. I have begun with simple nature based ones, to help the realistic aspect of the map 
prosper, but also things such as boxes and a moving truck as I am still focusing on the overarching
story/theme I want to present to my user as they traverse the space. It seems that I am having trouble
deciding on what types of mountains//hills I want for my project, I have developed a rough shape but I
am struggling to really settle on something that pleases me, my next comment is likely reflective of
my skill, but I am finding the raise/lower terrain tool quite temperamental. It seems to be quick to 
create a messy wave of tall mountains or clumps of risen ground in an instant, and so I constantly
find myself having to go back and erase, only to notice that there are odd chunks and bumps left from
the eraser too. I will of course have to workshop this and perhaps watch some videos or practice in a
separate scene to help develop/refine my skill. 

I have included screenshots of my work so far below. Ignore my hideously unorganised hierarchy. 

Week 8 Session 2!
